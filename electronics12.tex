\textcolor{green}{Kirchhoff's law }\\
Kirchhoff's laws are fundamental in circuit analysis, consisting of two rules: the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and the Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL).

\textcolor{red}{1. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)}

\textbf{Statement:} The total current entering a junction is equal to the total current leaving the junction. Mathematically,  
\[
\sum I_{\text{in}} = \sum I_{\text{out}}
\]

\textbf{Explanation:} At any junction in an electrical circuit, charge is conserved, so the sum of incoming currents equals the sum of outgoing currents.

\textcolor{red}{2. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)}

\textbf{Statement:} The sum of all voltages around a closed loop in a circuit is zero. Mathematically,  
\[
\sum V = 0
\]

\textbf{Explanation:} In any closed loop, the energy gained by charges from sources (like batteries) is equal to the energy lost through resistors or other components.

\textcolor{green}{\textbf{Wheatstone bridge Circuit}}


\textcolor{red}{Wheatstone Bridge}\\

The Wheatstone Bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit. It operates based on the principle of null deflection, where no current flows through the galvanometer when the bridge is balanced.\\

\textcolor{blue}{Circuit Diagram:}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 5 cm]{WheatstoneBridge}
\end{center}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}


\textbf{Balance Condition:}
\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{R_3}{R_4}
\]
When the bridge is balanced, the ratio of resistances in one leg equals the ratio in the other leg, and no current flows through the galvanometer.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textcolor{red}{Meter Bridge}\\

The Meter Bridge is a practical form of the Wheatstone Bridge used to measure unknown resistances. It consists of a one-meter-long wire of uniform cross-sectional area stretched over a meter scale.\\

\textcolor{blue}{Circuit Diagram:}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 5 cm]{meterbridge}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textbf{Working Principle:}  
The balance condition is achieved by adjusting the jockey on the wire until the galvanometer shows zero deflection. The unknown resistance \(R\) is then calculated using:
\[
\frac{R}{S} = \frac{l}{(100 - l)}
\]
where \(l\) is the balancing length.




\textcolor{green}{Potentiometer}

The potentiometer is an instrument used to measure the electromotive force (emf) of a cell, compare the emfs of two cells, and determine the internal resistance of a cell. It works on the principle that the potential difference across a uniform wire is directly proportional to its length when a constant current flows through it.

\textcolor{red}{1. Comparison of EMFs}

The potentiometer can be used to compare the emfs of two cells.

\node at (5,2.5) {\(L_1\)};
\node at (7,2.5) {\(L_2\)};
\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}  
Let \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) be the balancing lengths for the two cells \(E_1\) and \(E_2\), respectively. Since the potentiometer works on the principle of a null deflection, we have:
\[
\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{L_1}{L_2}
\]
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\textcolor{red}{2. Measurement of Internal Resistance of a Cell}

The potentiometer can also be used to measure the internal resistance \(r\) of a cell.

\textcolor{blue}{Circuit Diagram:}
\begin{center}
\begin{circuitikz}
\draw

\node at (5,2.5) {\(L_1\)};
\node at (7,2.5) {\(L_2\)};
\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}
 
1. Let \(L_1\) be the balancing length when the cell is in open circuit.  
2. Let \(L_2\) be the balancing length when the cell is connected to a known resistance \(R\).  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
The internal resistance \(r\) is given by:
\[
r = R \left(\frac{L_1}{L_2} - 1\right)
\]

\textbf{Explanation:}  
The balancing length \(L_1\) corresponds to the emf of the cell, while \(L_2\) corresponds to the potential difference across the cell when it delivers current through \(R\). The difference allows the calculation of \(r\).

\textcolor{red}{Conversion of Galvanometer to ammeter}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 6 cm]{gtoam}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Galvanometer:} A galvanometer is a sensitive device used to detect small currents.
\item \textbf{Add Shunt Resistor:} Connect a low-resistance shunt resistor in parallel with the galvanometer.
\item \textbf{Low Resistance:} The shunt should have a very low resistance to allow most current to bypass the galvanometer.
\item \textbf{Current Range:} The total resistance determines the ammeter’s current range.
\item \textbf{Calibration:} Calibrate the scale to show current instead of voltage.
\item \textbf{Adjust Sensitivity:} Ensure the galvanometer can measure small currents accurately without damage.
\item Calculate the shunt resistance using the formula:
$R_s=\frac{I_g G}{I-I_g}$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{red}{Conversion of Galvanometer to voltmeter}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 6 cm]{gtov}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Add Shunt Resistor:} Connect a large resistor in series.
\item \textbf{High Resistance:} Ensure the shunt has high resistance.
\item \textbf{Calibrate:} Adjust for accurate voltage readings.
\item \textbf{Voltage Range:} Set the total resistance for desired range.
\item \textbf{Adjust Scale:} Modify the scale to read voltage.

The voltage across the galvanometer at full-scale deflection is:

\[
V_g = I_g \cdot G
\]

To measure the maximum voltage \( V_{\text{max}} \), the total resistance of the voltmeter should be:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{I_g}
\]


\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
Now, the multiplier resistance \( R_m \) is the difference between the total resistance and the resistance of the galvanometer:

\[
R_m = R_{\text{total}} - G = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{I_g} - G
\]

Thus, the multiplier resistance required to convert the galvanometer into a voltmeter is:

\[
R_m = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{I_g} - G
\]
\end{frame}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Joule's Law of Heating}}\\
According to this law, the amount of heat (H) developed in an ohmic conductor by the passage of current I .\\
\begin{itemize}
\item[1] Directly proprtional to the square of the current $i.e. H\propto I^2$
\item[2] Directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor $H\propto R$
\item[3] Directly proportiona to the time flow of current $H\propto t$
\end{itemize}
On Combining above reltion we get,\\
\hspace{2cm} $H\propto I^2Rt$\\
\hspace{2cm} $H=kI^2Rt$\\
Where, k is the proportionality constant. The value of k depends on the system of unit of heat.\\
$k=\frac{1}{j}$ is the unit conversion factor. and Its value is 4.2 J/calorie.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10!white, colframe=green!50!black, title=Verification of Joule's Law]
To verify Joule's Law experimentally, we focus on the following three points:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Heat is directly proportional to the square of the current (\( I^2 \)):} \\
    By varying the current and keeping \( R \) and \( t \) constant, measure the heat produced. A plot of \( H \) vs \( I^2 \) should yield a straight line.

    \item \textbf{Heat is directly proportional to the resistance (\( R \)):} \\
    By varying the resistance and keeping \( I \) and \( t \) constant, measure the heat produced. A plot of \( H \) vs \( R \) should yield a straight line.

    \item \textbf{Heat is directly proportional to the time (\( t \)):} \\
    By varying the time and keeping \( I \) and \( R \) constant, measure the heat produced. A plot of \( H \) vs \( t \) should yield a straight line.

\section{Thermoelectric Effects}
\begin{frame}{Thermoelectric Effects}
    
Thermoelectric effects describe the direct conversion of temperature differences into electric voltage and vice versa. The two primary effects are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Seebeck Effect}
    \item \textbf{Peltier Effect}
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10!white, colframe=blue!50!black, title=Mathematical Explanation]
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{Seebeck Effect:} \\
The Seebeck effect generates a voltage when a temperature gradient is applied across a conductor. The voltage \( V \) is given by:
\[
V = S \cdot \Delta T
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \) is the Seebeck coefficient (material property),
    \item \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Thermocouple:}}\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 4 cm]{couple}
\end{center}
A couple of wires of dissimilar metals forming a loop and
producing thermoelectricity is called a thermocouple.\\
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Thermoelectric series:}}\\
Antimony, Iron, Zinc, Silver, Gold, Tin, Lead, Copper, Platinum, Nickel, Bismuth.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item This series has two main advantages: (a) to know the direction of current flow in the couple, (b) to find the thermo-emf in the thermo-couple.
\item In this series,Antimony-Bismuth (Sb–Bi) couple produces the maximum thermo-emf among any possible couple in the given series. 
\item Therefore, thermocouple is usually made up of Antimony and Bismuth.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\textcolor{violet}{Causes of Seebeck Effect}\\

The Seebeck Effect occurs due to the generation of a voltage when a temperature gradient is applied across a conductor or semiconductor. The primary causes are:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10!white, colframe=yellow!50!black, title=Causes of the Seebeck Effect]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Temperature Gradient:} \\
    A temperature difference (\( \Delta T \)) across a material causes charge carriers (electrons or holes) to diffuse from the hot end to the cold end, creating a voltage.

    \item \textbf{Charge Carrier Diffusion:} \\
    Electrons in the hotter region have higher kinetic energy and diffuse toward the colder region, leading to an accumulation of charge and an electric potential.

    \item \textbf{Material Properties:} \\
    The Seebeck coefficient (\( S \)) of a material determines how effectively it converts a temperature gradient into a voltage. Different materials have different \( S \) values.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{violet}{Verifaction of Thermo-emf(E) with temperature $(\theta)$:} \\

Thermo-emf increases until it attains maximum value and the temperature at which Thermo-emf becomes maximum is called neutral temperature.\\
Therefore, the temperature of hot junction at which the Thermo-emf becomes maximum is called neutral
temperature ($\theta_n$).
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 6 cm]{verifaction}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item In such condition, the relation between Thermo-emf and temperature is
given by,\\
\begin{center}
i.e. $E=\alpha\theta+\frac{1}{2}\beta\theta^2$ \\
\end{center}

where , $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants which are called thermoelectric coefficients.
\item \textbf{At neutral temperature:} The first derivative of emf w.r.t. temperature must be zero.\\
\begin{center}
i.e. $\frac{dE}{d\theta_n}=0$
\end{center}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\hspace{1cm} $\frac{d(\alpha\theta_n+\frac{1}{2}\beta\theta_n^2)}{d\theta}=0$\\
or, \hspace{3cm}$\alpha+\beta\theta_n=0$\\
$\implies$ \hspace{5cm} $\theta_n=-\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{At temperature of inversion:} The thermo emf is zero at the temperature of inversion ($\theta_i$) Beyond this temperature the thermo emf changes sign and direction current reverses. and E=0.\\
or, \hspace{2cm} $\alpha\theta_i+\frac{1}{2}\beta\theta_i^2=0$\\
or, \hspace{4cm} $\alpha+\frac{\beta\theta_i}{2}=0$\\
$\implies$ \hspace{6cm} $\theta_i=-\frac{2\alpha}{\beta}$
\item Therefore, the neutral temperature can be determined by taking average of temperature of inversion ($\theta_i$) and temperature of cold junction ($\theta_c$).\\
or. \hspace{2cm} i.e. $\theta_n=\frac{\theta_i+\theta_c}{2}$
\item In Cu-Fe thermocouple, neutral temperature is about $270^0 C$ when cold junction is maintained at $0^0C$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

\textbf{Peltier Effect:} \\
The Peltier effect describes heat absorption or release at the junction of two materials when an electric current flows through it. The heat \( Q \) is given by:
\[
Q = \Pi \cdot I
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \Pi \) is the Peltier coefficient,
    \item \( I \) is the electric current.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 4 cm]{pelter}
\end{center}
\textcolor{violet}{Cause of Peltier effect}
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to dissimilar metals have different electron densities.
\item Electrons tend to diffuse from higher potential metal to lower potential metal.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\textcolor{violet}{Thomson's Effect}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item When two ends of a metal conductor are maintained at different temperatures and current is passed through it, heat is evolved from one end and heat is absorbed at another end. 
\item[1] \textcolor{violet}{Positive thomson effect:} The evolution of heat in the part of conductor along which current flows in
the direction of temperature fall.\\
\includegraphics[width = 7 cm]{positive}
\item[2] \textcolor{violet}{Negative thomson effect:} When a current is sent in the iron rod in the direction from P to Q, the point P becomes hotter than point Q i.e., heat energy is transferred from Q to P.\\
\includegraphics[width = 7 cm]{negative}
\item If the direction of current in either of the above cases is reversed, the Thomson effect is also reversed. In lead, the Thomson effect is zero.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Thermopile:}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Thermopile is an electrical device that uses Seebeck effect to detect and measure the intensity of thermal radiation.
\item It works on the principle of thermoelectric effect.
\item t is constructed with the series combination of thermocouple made up of Antimony (Sb) and Bishmuth (Bi).

\hspace{5cm} \includegraphics[width = 3 cm]{Oersted's experiment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Oersted's experiment demonstrated that an electric current creates a magnetic field, establishing a fundamental connection between electricity and magnetism.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Electric Current and Magnetism:} A compass needle deflected when placed near a wire carrying electric current, showing that electricity produces magnetism.

\item \textbf{Direction of Magnetic Field:} The magnetic field's direction depends on the current's direction, forming circular lines around the wire.

\item \textbf{Foundation for Electromagnetism:} This discovery laid the groundwork for further studies in electromagnetism.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\textcolor{red}{Rules of finding direction of magnetic field}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1] \textcolor{violet}{maxwell's cork screw rule:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Direction of Magnetic Field:} If a right-handed cork screw is rotated in the direction of the current, the direction in which the screw moves represents the direction of the magnetic field around the current-carrying conductor.

\item \textbf{Circular Field Lines:} The magnetic field forms concentric circular loops around the wire, perpendicular to the direction of the current.
\end{itemize}
\item[2] \textcolor{violet}{Right hand thumb rule:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Direction of Magnetic Field:} If you grasp a current-carrying wire with your right hand.
\item The thumb pointing in the direction of the current, the curled fingers show the direction of the magnetic field around the wire.  


\end{itemize}
\item[3] \textcolor{violet}{Fleming left hand rule:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Force Direction:} Stretch the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of your left hand mutually perpendicular to each other; 
\item The forefinger points in the direction of the magnetic field, the middle finger in the direction of the current, and the thumb indicates the direction of the force on the conductor.

\textcolor{red}{Lorentz force:}\\
\say{The force experienced by a charged particle moving in an electromagnetic field}
\begin{itemize}
\item Electric force experienced by charge q is $\vec{F_e}=q\vec{E}$
\item Magnetic force experienced by charge q is  $\vec{F}=q(\vec{v}\times \vec{B})$\\
\item Net force experienced by charge q is given by $\vec{F}=q[\vec{E}+(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})]$ This is called the lorentz force at Electic force zero is.
\begin{equation}
or, \vec{F}=Bqv\sin\theta
\end{equation}
\item At the charge q is at rest v=0 and so $\vec{F}=0$
\item  At $\theta=0$ or $\theta=180^0$  the charge q is in parallel or antiparallel to the field so Minimum magnetic force is $\vec{F}=0$ 
\item At $\theta=90^0$ The charge q is in perpendicular to the field then it expericence the maximum magnetic force is $\vec{F}=Bqv$

\textbf{$F=Bqv_d\sin\theta$ }
\item Total number of charge in conductor is $N=nV=nAL$ \\
(where n= charge per unit volume and V is colume of conductor)
\item Net magnetic force $F=NBqv_d\sin\theta$
\end{itemize}
\hspace{1cm} $F=(nAL)Bqv_d\sin\theta$\\
\hspace{2cm} $\therefore$ \textbf{$F=(nqAv_d)(BL\sin\theta)$}\\
We know drift velocity $v_d=\frac{I}{nAq}$ By replacing terms by I (current) then we get \\

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Torque on Rectangular Current Loop}}\\
\includegraphics[width = 3 cm]{rectangle}
\includegraphics[width = 3 cm]{coils}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a rectangular current loop PQRS of a conducting wire with linear dimension L and b carrying current I through it, and is placed in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$.
\item The force acting on each side of the loop is described below.\\
\hspace{2cm} $F_{PQ} = IBb \sin\theta,$ (upward)\\
\hspace{2cm} $F_{RS} = IBb \sin\theta,$ (downward) both are equal and opposite and cancel each other.\\
\hspace{1cm} Here, PQ=RS=b (into the plane of paper) \\
$\therefore$ $F_{QR}=IBL\sin 90^0=IBL$\\
or,   $F_{PS}=IBL\sin 90^0=IBL$\\

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Torque ($\tau$) = Magnitude of either force $\times$ perpendicular distanace between them.\\

\begin{equation}
\therefore \tau= BINA\sin\alpha
\end{equation}
This is the required expression if torque on a rectangular current loop.

\item \textbf{Loop perpendicular to B:} The net force is zero as forces on opposite sides cancel out, and no torque is produced.
\item \textbf{Loop at an angle to B:} Unequal force alignment creates a couple, generating torque ($\tau$) that rotates the loop.

\textcolor{violet}{\textbf{Magnetic Field due to a long straight conductor carrying current}}\\
Consider a long, straight conductor carrying a steady current \( I \). The magnetic field at a perpendicular distance \( r \) from the wire is determined.\\

Since the magnetic field \( B \) is tangential to the circular path and has the same magnitude at all points on the loop, the line integral simplifies to:\\


$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = B \oint d\mathbf{l} = B (2\pi r)$\\

From Ampère’s Law, \hspace{1cm} $B (2\pi r) = \mu_0 I$\\

Solving for \( B \): \hspace{1cm} $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$\\
Thus, the magnetic field due to a long straight conductor carrying current is:

\[
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}

This result shows that the magnetic field is directly proportional to the current \( I \) and inversely proportional to the radial distance \( r \).

A toroid is a circular coil with \( N \) turns carrying a current \( I \). We consider an Amperian loop of radius \( r \) inside the toroid along a circular path.

Since the toroid has \( N \) turns, the total enclosed current is:

\begin{equation}
I_{\text{enc}} = N I

Since the magnetic field inside the toroid is tangential and constant along the loop, the integral simplifies to:


$B (2\pi r) = \mu_0 N I$ On Solving for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{2\pi r}

Thus, the magnetic field inside a toroid is:

\textcolor{violet}{Electromagnetic Induction:} \\

Electromagnetic Induction is the process by which a changing magnetic field generates an electric current in a conductor. This phenomenon, discovered by Michael Faraday, forms the basis of many electrical devices, such as generators and transformers. It occurs when a conductor (like a wire) is exposed to a varying magnetic field, causing electrons to move and produce an electric current.\\

\textcolor{blue}{Key: characterostics:}\\

    \begin{itemize}
    \item  Changing Magnetic Field: Induction occurs when the magnetic field around a conductor changes.

\item Induced Current: A changing magnetic field creates an electric current in the conductor.

\item Faraday’s Law: The induced current is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field.

% Slide for Chapter: Alternating Currents
\section{Alternating Currents}
\begin{frame}{Alternating Currents}
\textcolor{red}{Introduction:}\\
Alternating Current (AC) is an electric current that periodically reverses direction, commonly used in homes and industries. Its ability to be easily transformed makes it ideal for efficient power transmission.

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{violet}{Instantenous value of Ac:}\\
\say{Instantaneous AC refers to the value of alternating current or voltage at any specific moment in time. It varies continuously with the AC waveform. }
instantaneous alternating current is given by,
\[
I(t)=I_0\sin\omega t
\]
where, $I_0$ is the peak value of current.\\
\textcolor{violet}{Peak value of current:}\\
\say{The peak value of alternating quantity is the value of voltage or current at the positive or negative maximum with respect to zero.} This is also called as amplitudes of alternating quantity $I_0$.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 9 cm]{peakvalueac}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{violet}{Average or mean value of A.C}\\
\say{The average (mean) value of AC over a full cycle is zero because the positive and negative halves cancel out. However, over a half-cycle, it is given by:}
\[
i.e\hspace{1cm} I_{av}=\frac{2}{\pi}I_0 \hspace{1cm} or, \hspace{1cm} V_{av}=\frac{2}{\pi}V_0
\]
Where, $I_0$ and $V_0$ are the maximum value of current and voltage.\\

\textcolor{violet}{Proof:}\\

The average value of an alternating current (AC) or voltage is calculated over a half-cycle, as the full-cycle average is zero due to symmetry.

For a sinusoidal AC voltage or current:

\[
V = V_0 \sin\theta
\]

where \( V_0 \) is the peak value and \( \theta \) is the phase angle (in radians).

\textbf{Step 1: Formula for Average Value}
The average value over a half-cycle (0 to \( \pi \)) is given by:

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\[
V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\pi V_0 \sin\theta \, d\theta
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Evaluating the Integral}

\[
V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{V_0}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta
\]

We know that: \textcolor{blue}{$\int \sin\theta \, d\theta = -\cos\theta$}\\


Applying limits from \( 0 \) to \( \pi \):

\[
\left[-\cos\theta\right]_0^\pi = -\cos\pi + \cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Final Expression}

\[
V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{V_0}{\pi} \times 2 = \frac{2V_0}{\pi}
\]

Thus, the \textbf{average or mean value of AC} over a half-cycle is:

\[
V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{2V_0}{\pi} \hspace{1cm} or \hspace{1cm} I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{2I_0}{\pi}
\]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{violet}{\textbf{RMS value of AC}}\\
The RMS value of an alternating current (AC) or voltage is the effective value that produces the same heating effect as a direct current (DC) of the same magnitude. It is mathematically defined as:
\[
V_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}v^2dt}
\]
For Sinusoidal AC voltage or current:
\[
V=V_0\sin\theta
\]
The RMS value over one full cycle is defined as:
\[
V_{rms}=\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
Similarly, For current: 
\[
 I_{rms}=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}
 \]
 The RMS value is widely used in electrical calculations, as it represents the practical or effective value of AC in power systems.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\textcolor{blue}{Proof For $I_{rms}$ value of AC}\\
The RMS value of AC current over one full cycle is given by:

\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T I^2 dt}
\]

For a sinusoidal AC current: $I = I_0 \sin\theta$

where \( I_0 \) is the peak current , And the RMS formula becomes:

\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} I_0^2 \sin^2\theta \, d\theta}
\]

Using the standard integral identity: $\int_0^{2\pi} \sin^2\theta \, d\theta = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi$\\

\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{I_m^2}{2\pi} \times \pi}
\]
$I_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{I_0^2}{2}} \implies I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}} $ 



RMS value of a sinusoidal AC waveform is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) times its peak value.

\begin{frame}
\textcolor{violet}{Phase shift between two wave forms:}\\
The phase shift between two waveforms is the difference in their phase angles, 
\[
\Delta\theta=\theta_2-\theta_1
\]

\textcolor{blue}{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Positive $\Delta\theta$→ Waveform 2 leads Waveform 1.
\item Negative $\Delta\theta$ → Waveform 2 lags Waveform 1.
\item $180^0$ phase shift → The waveforms are completely out of phase.
\item $0^0$ or $360^0$ phase shift → The waveforms are in phase (aligned).

\hspace{6cm} $I(t) = \frac{V_0\sin(\omega t)}{R}$\\
Define peak current as:  $I_0 = \frac{V_0}{R}$
Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
I(t) = I_0 \sin(\omega t)

\[
V(t) = L \frac{dI(t)}{dt}
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Solve for \( I(t) \)}

\[

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}

Dividing both sides by \( L \):

\[
\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = \frac{V_0}{L} \sin(\omega t)
\]

Integrating both sides:

\[
I(t) = \int \frac{V_0}{L} \sin(\omega t) dt
\]

\[
I(t) = \frac{V_0}{L} \int \sin(\omega t) dt
\]

Using the integral:

\[
\int \sin(\omega t) dt = -\frac{\cos(\omega t)}{\omega}
\]

\[
I(t) = -\frac{V_0}{L \omega} \cos(\omega t)

Consider an R-L series circuit with an applied voltage \( V(t) = V_0 \sin(\omega t) \). The total voltage across the resistor and inductor is:

\[
V(t) = V_R(t) + V_L(t)
\]

Using Ohm's Law for the resistor:

\[
V_R(t) = I(t) R
\]

And for the inductor:

\[
V_L(t) = L \frac{dI(t)}{dt}
\]

Thus, applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL):

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\[
V_0 \sin(\omega t) = I(t) R + L \frac{dI(t)}{dt}
\]

\textbf{Solve the Differential Equation}

This is a first-order linear differential equation:

\[
L \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + I(t) R = V_0 \sin(\omega t)
\]

Solve the homogeneous equation first:

\[
L \frac{dI_h(t)}{dt} + I_h(t) R = 0
\]

The solution to the homogeneous equation is:

\[
I_h(t) = A e^{-\frac{R}{L} t}
\]

Next, solve the non-homogeneous equation using the method of undetermined coefficients. Assume a solution of the form:

\[
I(t) = I_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi)
\]

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}

Substitute this into the equation \( L \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + I(t) R = V_0 \sin(\omega t) \):

\[
L \cdot I_0 \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi) + I_0 R \sin(\omega t + \phi) = V_0 \sin(\omega t)
\]

Using trigonometric identities, we get:

\[
I_0 (L \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi) + R \sin(\omega t + \phi)) = V_0 \sin(\omega t)
\]

Equating the coefficients of \( \sin(\omega t) \) and \( \cos(\omega t) \), we get two equations:

\[
I_0 R \cos(\phi) = V_0 \quad \text{(coefficient of } \sin(\omega t))
\]

\[
I_0 L \omega \sin(\phi) = 0 \quad \text{(coefficient of } \cos(\omega t))
\]

\textbf{Solve for \( I_0 \) and \( \phi \)}

From the first equation:

\[
I_0 = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + (L \omega)^2}}
\]

From the second equation, solving for the phase angle \( \phi \):

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}


\[
\tan(\phi) = \frac{L \omega}{R}
\]

Thus, the phase angle \( \phi \) is:

\[
\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{L \omega}{R}\right)
\]

\textbf{Current Expression}

The current in the circuit is:

\[
I(t) = I_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi)
\]

where:

\[
I_0 = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + (L \omega)^2}}, \quad \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{L \omega}{R}\right)
\]

\textbf{Conclusion}

For an R-L series circuit, the current \( I(t) \) is sinusoidal with:

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The peak current \( I_0 = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + (L \omega)^2}} \).
    \item The phase shift \( \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{L \omega}{R}\right) \), indicating that the current \textbf{lags} the voltage by a phase angle \( \phi \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impedance of R-L Circuit}

The total impedance \( Z \) of the R-L circuit is:

\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (L \omega)^2}
\]

Thus, the peak current can be expressed as:

\[
I_0 = \frac{V_0}{Z}
\]

\textbf{Apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)}

Consider an R-C series circuit with an applied AC voltage \( V(t) = V_0 \sin(\omega t) \). The total voltage across the resistor and capacitor is:

\[
V(t) = V_R(t) + V_C(t)
\]

Using Ohm’s Law for the resistor:

\[
V_R(t) = I(t) R
\]

For the capacitor, the voltage is related to the current by:

\[
V_C(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int I(t) dt
\]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Thus, applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law:

\[
V_0 \sin(\omega t) = I(t) R + \frac{1}{C} \int I(t) dt
\]

\textbf{Solve the Differential Equation}

Taking the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to time:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( V_0 \sin(\omega t) \right) = R \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + \frac{I(t)}{C}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
V_0 \omega \cos(\omega t) = R \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + \frac{I(t)}{C}
\]

This is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we use the method of undetermined coefficients, assuming a solution of the form:

\[
I(t) = I_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi)
\]

\textbf{Substitute the Assumed Solution}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Substitute \( I(t) = I_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi) \) into the differential equation. First, calculate the derivative:

\[
\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = I_0 \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]

Substitute into the equation:

\[
V_0 \omega \cos(\omega t) = R I_0 \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi) + \frac{I_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi)}{C}
\]

Using trigonometric identities, we get:

\[
I_0 \left( R \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi) + \frac{\sin(\omega t + \phi)}{C} \right) = V_0 \omega \cos(\omega t)
\]

\textbf{Solve for the Amplitude and Phase Shift}

By equating the coefficients of \( \sin(\omega t) \) and \( \cos(\omega t) \), we get:

\[
I_0 \left( R \omega \cos(\phi) + \frac{1}{C} \sin(\phi) \right) = V_0 \omega
\]

From this, the magnitude of the current is:


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}


\[
I_0 = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( \frac{1}{C \omega} \right)^2}}
\]

The phase angle \( \phi \) is given by:

\[
\tan(\phi) = \frac{\frac{1}{C \omega}}{R}
\]

Thus, the phase shift \( \phi \) is:

\[
\phi = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{R C \omega} \right)
\]

\textbf{Current Expression}

Finally, the current in the circuit is:

\[
I(t) = I_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi)
\]

where:
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

\[
I_0 = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( \frac{1}{C \omega} \right)^2}}, \quad \phi = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{R C \omega} \right)
\]

\textbf{Conclusion}

For an R-C series circuit, the current \( I(t) \) is sinusoidal with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The peak current \( I_0 = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( \frac{1}{C \omega} \right)^2}} \).

Apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL),
Consider an L-C-R series circuit with an applied AC voltage \( V(t) = V_0 \sin(\omega t) \). The total voltage across the resistor, inductor, and capacitor is:

\[
V(t) = V_R(t) + V_L(t) + V_C(t)

Using Ohm’s Law for the resistor:

V_R(t) = I(t) R


For the inductor:

\[

\]


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
For the capacitor:

\[

Thus, applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law:

\]

Take the derivative of both sides with respect to time:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( V_0 \sin(\omega t) \right) = R \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + L \frac{d^2I(t)}{dt^2} + \frac{I(t)}{C}

Simplifying:

\[

This is a second-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we assume a solution of the form:

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}

\[

\]

Substitute \( I(t) = I_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi) \) into the differential equation. First, compute the derivatives:

\[
\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = I_0 \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]

\[
\frac{d^2I(t)}{dt^2} = -I_0 \omega^2 \sin(\omega t + \phi)
\]

Substitute these into the equation:

\[

Using trigonometric identities, we get:



$I_0 \left( R \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi) + \frac{\sin(\omega t + \phi)}{C} - L \omega^2 \sin(\omega t + \phi) \right) = V_0 \omega \cos(\omega t)$
\end{frame}

\textcolor{violet}{\textbf{Amplitude and Phase Shift}}

By equating the coefficients of \( \sin(\omega t) \) and \( \cos(\omega t) \), we obtain:

    I_0 \omega \left( R \cos(\phi) - L \omega \sin(\phi) \right) = V_0 \omega

    \item Coefficients of \( \sin(\omega t) \):
    \[
    I_0 \omega \left( R \sin(\phi) + L \omega \cos(\phi) \right) = 0

Solve these two equations for the amplitude \( I_0 \) and phase \( \phi \).

The amplitude of the current is:

The total impedance \( Z \) of the L-C-R circuit is:

\[

\]
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

Thus, the peak current can also be written as:

For an L-C-R series circuit, the current \( I(t) \) is sinusoidal with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The peak current \( I_0 = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( L \omega - \frac{1}{C \omega} \right)^2}} \).

\end{itemize}

The impedance of the circuit is:

\]

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}



Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( R \) is the resistance,
    \item \( L \) is the inductance,
    \item \( C \) is the capacitance,
    \item \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the AC source.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Condition for Resonance}

Resonance occurs when the reactive component (inductive reactance \( X_L = L \omega \) and capacitive reactance \( X_C = \frac{1}{C \omega} \)) cancel each other out. This happens when:

\[
X_L = X_C \quad \Rightarrow \quad L \omega = \frac{1}{C \omega}
\]

\textbf{for Angular Frequency}

From the condition \( L \omega = \frac{1}{C \omega} \), we solve for \( \omega \):

\[
L \omega^2 = \frac{1}{C} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \omega^2 = \frac{1}{LC}
\]
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

Thus, the angular frequency at resonance is:

\[
\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
\]

\textbf{Resonance Frequency}

The resonance frequency \( f_0 \) in Hertz is related to the angular frequency \( \omega_0 \) by:

\[
f_0 = \frac{\omega_0}{2 \pi} = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}
\]
\textcolor{blue}{Three special Cases:}

\textbf{1. Inductive Case (When the circuit is inductive)}

\textbf{Condition}: \( X_L > X_C \) (Inductive reactance greater than capacitive reactance)

\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + \left( X_L - X_C \right)^2}
\]
Where \( X_L = L \omega \) and \( X_C = \frac{1}{C \omega} \).

\textbf{Phase}: The current \textit{lags} the voltage by an angle \( \phi \) where:
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

\[
\tan(\phi) = \frac{X_L - X_C}{R}
\]

\textbf{2. Capacitive Case (When the circuit is capacitive)}

\textbf{Condition}: \( X_L < X_C \) (Capacitive reactance greater than inductive reactance)

\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + \left( X_C - X_L \right)^2}
\]
Where \( X_L = L \omega \) and \( X_C = \frac{1}{C \omega} \).

\textbf{Phase}: The current \textit{leads} the voltage by an angle \( \phi \) where:
\[
\tan(\phi) = \frac{X_C - X_L}{R}
\]

\textbf{3. Resonance Case (When the circuit is at resonance)}

\textbf{Condition}: \( X_L = X_C \) (Inductive reactance equals capacitive reactance)
\[
L \omega = \frac{1}{C \omega}
\]
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\textbf{Impedance}: 
\[
Z = R

\textbf{Voltage and Current in an LCR Circuit}

For an AC voltage source:
\[
    V = V_0 \cos(\omega t)
    \]

Let the current through the circuit be:
\[
    I = I_0 \cos(\omega t - \phi)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V_0$ and $I_0$ are the peak voltage and peak current,
    \item $\omega$ is the angular frequency,
    \item $\phi$ is the phase angle between voltage and current.
\end{itemize}
\[
    Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}
\]
   \hspace{2cm} $X_L &= \omega L \quad \text{(Inductive Reactance)}$ \\
    \hspace{2cm} $X_C &= \frac{1}{\omega C} \quad \text{(Capacitive Reactance)}$
    \end{frame}
   
   
    \begin{frame}
The phase angle is given by:
\[
    \tan \phi = \frac{X_L - X_C}{R}
\]

\textbf{Instantaneous Power} $  P(t) = V(t) \cdot I(t)$
Substituting the values of $V$ and $I$:
\[
    P(t) = V_0 \cos(\omega t) \cdot I_0 \cos(\omega t - \phi)
\]
Using the trigonometric identity:
\[
    \cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) + \cos(A + B)]
\]
we get:
\[
    P(t) = \frac{V_0 I_0}{2} [\cos \phi + \cos(2\omega t - \phi)]
\]

\textbf{Average Power (Real Power)}
The average power over a complete cycle is given by:
\[
    P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T P(t) dt
\]
Since the integral of $\cos(2\omega t - \phi)$ over one cycle is zero, we obtain:

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\[
    P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{V_0 I_0}{2} \cos \phi
\]

Using RMS values ($V_{\text{rms}} = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}$), we rewrite the expression as:
\[
    P_{\text{avg}} = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} \cos \phi
\]
$P_{\text{avg}} = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} \cos \phi$, which determines the actual energy consumed in the circuit.\\
 
\textcolor{violet}{Q Factor in LCR Circuit}\\
The Q Factor (Quality Factor) of an LCR circuit is a dimensionless parameter that measures the sharpness of resonance in the circuit.\\
 It is defined as:
\[
Q=\frac{Resonant \ Frequency (f_0)}{Bnadwidth(\Delta f)}
\]
Equivalently, 
\[
Q=\frac{\omega_0 L}{R}=\frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
\]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Where: $f_0= \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}$ is resonant frequency, $\Delta f=\frac{R}{2\pi L} $ is Bandwidth\\
$\omega_0=2\pi f_0$ is angular resonant frequency, R,L,C have their usual meaning.
